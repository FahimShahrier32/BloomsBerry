# Design: Dedicated "About Us" Page (The Bloomsberry Journey)

**Status**: Planning
**Date**: 2026-02-24

## Overview
Expand the existing "About Us" section into a dedicated page (`/about`) that tells the compelling story of Bloomsberry's founding in 2025 with an **Elevated & Culinary** tone.

## Structure & Narrative Sections

### 1. Hero Section (The Vision)
- **Visual**: High-quality video or image of a perfect pour-over or a signature fusion dish.
- **Copy**: "Establish in 2025: A New Era of Culinary Refinement."
- **Goal**: Immediate premium impact.

### 2. The Bloomsberry Journey (The Story)
- **Narrative**: Use the approved text focusing on Dhanmondi, fusion cuisine, and specialty coffee craft.
- **Layout**: alternating text and image blocks (Z-pattern) for readability and visual interest.

### 3. Visual Showcase (The Vibe)
- **Visual**: A gallery or slider showing the "glassy, modern interior" and "botanical freshness."
- **Goal**: Allow users to fully immerse themselves in the Bloomsberry atmosphere.

### 4. Culinary Pillars
- Expanded entries for **Unique Vibe** and **Fusion Cuisine**.
- Include specific mentions of Pan-Asian and Chinese fusion inspirations.

### 4. Interactive Elements
- Subtle parallax effects on background elements.
- "Back to Home" button with the same premium hover styles as the main site.

## Technical Implementation
- **Route**: `src/app/about/page.tsx`
- **Components**: Reuse `Navbar` and `Footer`.
- **Styling**: Maintain the `#2D3A2F` (Deep Green) and `#F8FAF8` (Off-white) palette.

## Navigation Update
- Add a "Learn More" button to the homepage `About` section.
- Primary CTA: `btn-primary` style with a smooth transition to the top of the new page.
